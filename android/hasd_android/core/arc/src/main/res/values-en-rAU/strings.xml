	<string name="about_header">About this App</string>
	<string name="about_body">The Ambulatory Research in Cognition (ARC) app was designed by the Cognitive Technology Research Laboratory (CTRLab) in the Department of Neurology at Washington University in St. Louis for participants enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) studies. The ARC app assesses cognition using frequently administered but brief cognitive tests. This app is intended for use only by participants enrolled in DIAN studies.</string>

	<string name="faq_testing_header">Testing FAQ</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_q1">How long do I have to take tests?</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_q2">Do I have to take the test as soon as I get the notification?</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_q3">What if I miss some tests?</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_q4">How do I know when I have finished the test?</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_q5">How do I know when the next week of testing starts?</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_q6">What should I do if I keep getting the message, \"No tests available at this time\"?</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_q7">Can I change my testing schedule?</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_q8">Can I see how I\'m doing on the tests?</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_q9">Can I let my friend/grandchild/spouse take some of the tests?</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_q10">I\'m not sure I\'m doing the test correctly. Can I practice?</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_a1">You will get notifications for tests four times per day for one week, then no tests for the next &lt;b>6&lt;/b> months. The individual tests take approximately 3 to 5 minutes to complete. A new week of tests will start every six months for as long as you are in the study.</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_a2">You will have up to two hours from the time you get the notification to take the test. After two hours, you will no longer be able to complete that test session.</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_a3">While we want you to complete as many tests as possible, we realize that you may lead a very busy life! It\'s ok to miss a few tests, but please try to complete as many as possible - they only take 3-5 minutes each. Also, when you get a notification, you have two hours to take the test; you do not have to drop everything and take the test immediately.</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_a4">At the end of the tests, you will be asked to answer whether or not you were interrupted during any of the tests. Once you have answered this question, you will then sign your initials and press \"Submit\". This will mark the end of the test.</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_a5">If you are not currently in a testing cycle, the app home page will indicate the dates of your next week of testing. Additionally, you will get reminder notifications one month, one week, and one day out from each testing cycle. You will have the option to adjust the dates of your testing cycle by one week.</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_a6">If you open the app and see \"There are no tests to take right now\", it is possible that you have missed the 2-hour window for your test session. You will receive a notification when it is time to take your next test. That test will be available for 2-hours following the notification. \n\nIf you see the message \"There are no tests to take right now\" and feel that this is in error, please contact your study coordinator.</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_a7">You can change the time of day you are available to take your tests at any point. To change the time of day you are available for testing, choose \"Resources\" from the navigation bar at the bottom of the app screen, then \"Change My Availability\", and finally \"I would like to change the &lt;b>time of day&lt;/b> I am available for testing.\" \n\nAdditionally, you can change the dates of an upcoming testing cycle when you have finished your current testing cycle. To change the dates of your next testing cycle, choose \"Resources\" from the navigation bar at the bottom of the app screen, then \"Change My Availability\", and finally \"I would like to change the &lt;b>dates&lt;/b> of my next &lt;b>testing cycle&lt;/b>.\"</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_a8">You will not be able to see the results of the tests. The data collected during the tests is for research purposes only and is not intended to make a diagnosis or treat a condition. Please contact your study coordinator if you have any concerns.</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_a9">We ask that you complete the tests yourself, as part of your participation in the study. Following each test, you will be asked to sign your initials to verify that you were the one who completed the test.</string>
	<string name="faq_testing_a10">You can review the tutorials at any time as a way to \"practice\" taking the tests. To do this, choose \"View a Tutorial\" on the instruction screen of a test.</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_header">Technical FAQ</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_q1">What do I do if I change phones?</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_q2">The app isn\'t working. What should I do?</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_q3">What data is being collected?</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_q4">How do I check if notifications are set up correctly?</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_q5">How do I resolve two-step verification issues?</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_q6">What is the Test Scheduler Service?</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_q7">Why am I getting a message telling me to close other apps?</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_a1">You will need to re-install the app if you change to a different phone. You also will need to contact your study coordinator so that s/he can disable the app on your previous phone in order to allow you to log in from a new phone.</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_a2">Contact your study coordinator. If s/he cannot get the app to work in the moment, s/he will get back to you ASAP with a solution.</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_a3">We collect your initials via the signature page as well as the results of your neurocognitive tests. The data will save to you phone until there is a connection. Once there is a connection, your data will be securely transferred directly from the mobile app to the study database using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with encryption.</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_a4">Your notifications are set up when you define your availability. You will receive 4 testing notifications per day during your availability window. You can change this window via Resources in the app navigation bar.</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_a5">If you are having issues with two-step verification, the first step is to verify the phone digits on the page that asks you to enter a login verification code. These two digits should be the same as the last two digits of your phone number. If these digits do not match your phone number, please contact your study coordinator. If these digits do match your phone number, the next step is to send a new code to your phone number. You can do this by clicking \"Didn\'t receive code?\" on the page that asks you to enter a login verification code. If the new code does not work (or you do not receive a code), please contact your study coordinator.</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_a6">During testing weeks, you may see a notification that the Test Scheduler Service is running. This service allows us to send you testing notifications at specific times. Since this is required for the study, it cannot be disabled.\n\nThe Test Scheduler Service will only run during testing weeks and will not significantly impact the battery life of your phone.</string>
	<string name="faq_tech_a7">You may see this message appear during a test session: “Please close other apps to improve performance.” This may mean your device is not capable of running other apps at the same time as EXR. For the best performance, please close other apps before starting a test session.</string>

	<string name="faq_earnings_a1">You can earn up to $32 per 7-day testing cycle for as long as you are in the study. You earn $0.50 for each test you complete (up to $14 per cycle). You also can work toward three bonus goals: $1 per day for completing all four tests in one day (up to $7 per cycle); $6 per cycle for completing two or more tests each day; and $5 per cycle for completing 21 or more tests.</string>
	<string name="faq_earnings_a2">Your payment will be processed immediately upon completion of a testing cycle. It may take several business days for your payment to be processed. Please contact your study coordinator if you have any questions about when you will receive your payment.</string>
	<string name="faq_earnings_a3">You will be paid via an electronic Amazon gift card.</string>
	<string name="faq_earnings_a4">This week refers to the amount of money you have earned during the current testing cycle. \"Study total\" refers to the cumulative amount of money you have earned from all testing cycles, including the current one.</string>
	<string name="faq_earnings_a5">Bonus goals are money that can be earned above and beyond the $0.50 earned per completed test session. During each testing cycle, you can work toward three bonus goals: $1 per day for completing all four tests in one day (up to $7 per cycle); $6 per cycle for completing two or more tests each day; and $5 per cycle for completing 21 or more tests. You are able to earn money for all three bonus goals.</string>
